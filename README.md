# ConnectKid

## Description

ConnectKid is an application that single parents, and parents can utilize in order to connect with other parents' and children within their community. A lot of folks have a hard time scheduling activities with their children and attend events that don't require constant attendance (ie. Soccer, swimming, etc). This application works with parents' schedules and allows for virtual meetups and in person events. All of the events are child friendly and focus on inclusivity and promoting interpersonal skills.

### Problem

- Parents have limited time in the day to reach out to other parents and schedule play dates, or attend events with their children.
- If a parent is a working parent, it is even more difficult to attend events such as soccer games or PTA meetings, it can feel like work consumes their day.
- Children feel disconnected after COVID and need to understand each others differences and strengthen communication skills.

### Solution

- ConnectKid has virtual cooking sessions where children are welcome to assist in the kitchen while their parent(s) talk to other parents.
- Relieves the pressure of having to commit to an in person event first and allows them to ease into the process.
- ConnectKid provides accessibility tips for children with autism or have an inability to walk. By
  promoting inclusivity and information that is readily available and easy to read, there is a real opportunity for all children to become connected and understand each other!

### User Story

As a parent that seeks to connect with my community and promote interpersonal relationships with my child and other children. I want an app that I can go to and sign up for events within my community that work with my schedule. I do not want to commit to paying a monthly membership fee and would like to have all accessibility tips at my fingertips.
I want to also have an option for virtual events to "break the ice" and get to know a few folks before attending an in person event. I want an app that not only promotes communication and connection, but is inclusive to all types of children so we can all work to understand each other and build a better future for our kids.
